  - Any other idea that you can think of

## Requirements

- Full-stack application with user authentication.
- Frontend (client) and backend (server).
- Database for data storage and retrieval.
- Project Documentation

### User Scenarios

- A way to understand user's need and promote empathy before designing stage.

> **Example**

Rodrigo, as a Digital Marketing Program Manager, is tasked with scheduling courses based on the availability of instructors. Currently, he manages incoming cohorts using cumbersome spreadsheets, manually assigning instructors to each class session. However, this manual process becomes increasingly challenging as instructor availability fluctuates due to various factors such as subject expertise, class shifts, days of the week, and other commitments.

Rodrigo is decided to find an application his needs because he wants to:

1. Dynamically tracks and updates instructor availability based on their schedules, preferences, and other commitments.
2. Provides a user-friendly interface for managing cohorts, courses, and instructor assignments seamlessly eg. Dashboard and drag and drop.
3. Enables communication and collaboration between instructors, allowing them to update their availability and preferences directly within the platform.
4. Incorporates intelligent algorithms or predictive analytics to suggest optimal instructor assignments based on availability, expertise, and class requirements. (Stretch)

### User stories

- General explanation of a software features from the perspective of a user
- focuses on delivering value to the user

> **Example**

**As a** user,
**I want to** be able to drag and drop course orders
**so that I** can reschedule courses easily depending on instructors' availability.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Product with just enough features to satisfy early customers
- Decide which features will be part of the MVP.
- Keep as simple as possible
- Get feedback and continue development

### Wireframes

- Low-fidelity,
- Simple sketches of the user interface without graphics nor colors.
- Plan the layout and prioritize content and functionalities.

### Mock Design

> You came to this program to learn how to be a developer, not a designer. However, it is important to have a good design. You can use a tool like Figma to create your design.

- Hi-fidelity
- Websites for inspiration:
  - [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
  - [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
  - [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/)
  - [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
  - [CSS Design Awards](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/)

**Cool idea:** Try to talk to UI/UX students and ask them to help you with the design.

### Tech choices

- What technologies will you use?

> **Examples**

- Frontend
  - React
  - Next
- Backend
  - Express
- Database
  - PostgreSQL
  - MongoDB

> You may use other technologies, but you may get less support depending on instructor expertise in certain tooling.

### ERD

- Identify the entities and relationships:
  - One to one
  - One to many
  - Many to many (create a join table)
- Draw the ERD

## Workflows

### Git

- Never code on main branch
- Never force push main branch
- Merge conflicts happens. There are ways of minimizing them but you can never get rid of them completely.
- Use branches and pull requests

1. Create a new branch ->
2. Work on the branch ->
3. Make a commit ->
4. Push to remote branch ->
5. Make a pull request ->
6. **CONFLICTS**
7. Checkout to main/develop ->
8. Pull ->
9. Checkout to the branch ->
10. Merge main/develop ->
11. Fix conflicts ->
12. Commit ->
13. Push ->
14. Merge pull request

## Project management

- Use a project management tool like GitHub Projects.
- Create a board for your project
- Add tasks/issues based on your user stories
- Allocate tasks to team members
- Estimate tasks and set due date (it is ok to change them later)

## Communication

- Use a communication tool like Slack.
- Create a chatroom for your project
- Add team members
- Invite your instructor to the chatroom
- Use the channel to communicate
- Daily standup
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What are you going to do today?
  - Do you have any blockers?
- Weekly report with Instructor (Decide Day and Time - first come, first serve)
  - Update on the project
  - What did you learn this week?
  - What are your blockers?
  - What are your goals for the next week?
  - Update on the deadlines

## Please keep in mind!!

- if something fails in your team, it is not one of your team member's failure but WHOLE TEAM.
- if you do not want to lead, follow the lead
- Decide as a team
- Be responsive - no longer than half day
- Please flag if you think you are behind
- If you stuck on a problem more than 1 hour, It is time to ask for help
- Take an action instead of keep thinking
