Rodrigo, as a Digital Marketing Program Manager, is tasked with scheduling courses based on the availability of instructors. Currently, he manages incoming cohorts using cumbersome spreadsheets, manually assigning instructors to each class session. However, this manual process becomes increasingly challenging as instructor availability fluctuates due to various factors such as subject expertise, class shifts, days of the week, and other commitments.

Rodrigo is decided to find an application his needs because he wants to:

1. Dynamically tracks and updates instructor availability based on their schedules, preferences, and other commitments.
2. Provides a user-friendly interface for managing cohorts, courses, and instructor assignments seamlessly eg. Dashboard and drag and drop.
3. Enables communication and collaboration between instructors, allowing them to update their availability and preferences directly within the platform.
4. Incorporates intelligent algorithms or predictive analytics to suggest optimal instructor assignments based on availability, expertise, and class requirements. (Stretch) efkbgeweiyefherwuk
